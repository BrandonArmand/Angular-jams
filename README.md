# Angular Jams

![Bloc Jams](http://brandonarmand.com/images/blocjams.png "Basic site clip")

Angular Jams is a remake of a past site that I made called bloc-jams. This version is made using Angular and jQuery. Angular Jams is a music streaming platform for sorting through albums and songs to discover songs.

## Site

Angular Jams can be found at https://angular-bloc.herokuapp.com/

### Site Navigation

Angular Jams is a very simple site. The first thing you will notice is the very stylish landing page with some very convincing selling points ;)

you can browse through the albums (though at the time of making the site, I focused on functionality over actual content, so a single album loops to fill the screen) and within the albums are the album information and playable songs with a very nice song player.

The song player is an Angular service that can be used on any page of the site, so you aren't just limited to the single album page to listen to the songs. The player alows users to skip through the song, skip to the next and last song, change the volume, and stick to the bottom of the page to allways be view!
